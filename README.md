# Password-Generator-HWK3
This project generates a random password given input from the user. The user will select a length (from 8 to 128 characters) and then confirm which character types the password should contain (upper case, lower case, numbers, and/or special characters). Given this input, a random password will be displayed on the page.

## Motivation
In attempt to build my knowledge and experience with JavaScript, I was provided the HTML and CSS code by my coding bootcamp with the University of Denver. I chose to build the password generator function using if/else statements and a for loop.
