# Password-Generator-HWK3
This project generates a random password given input from the user. The user will select a length (from 8 to 128 characters) and then confirm which character types the password should contain (upper case, lower case, numbers, and/or special characters). Given this input, a random password will be displayed on the page.

### Motivation
In attempt to build my knowledge and experience with JavaScript, I was provided the HTML and CSS code by my coding bootcamp with the University of Denver. I chose to build the password generator function using if/else statements and a for loop. 

# Homework Criteria

### User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Acceptance Criteria

When 'Generate Password' button is clicked, 
a series of prompts allow the user to select
password length of at least 8 and up to 128 characters.
Then the user is asked to confirm which character types 
are preferred out of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special.
Answers are validated to ensure minimum criteria is met: 
between 8-128 characters and at least one character type.
When valid selections have been made, a password meeting 
the criteria is generated and written to the page.
